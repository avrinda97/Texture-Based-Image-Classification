# Texture-Based-Image-Classification
In this Project, a texture classification system based on Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is presented.
Classification of images into various categories is being realized by extracting six statistical features, namely - Contrast, Correlation, Energy, Dissimilarity,  ASM and Homogeneity from each image and using this feature database to train the K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier.
Upon feeding the trained k-NN classifier with the Test Images from various categories, a decent classification accuracy was achieved.
